❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.
*   ❌ The function does not accept any parameters, limiting its reusability.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

*   ✔ The function now accepts parameters `a` and `b`, making it more flexible and reusable.
*   ✔ The function returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
*   ✔ Explicitly defining parameters improves code clarity and reduces the risk of errors.
